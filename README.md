# Weather Analysis Website

This project builds on a previous project, which analyzed how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. We accomplished this analysis by pulling data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities and using Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude.

This project takes all of the plots and data we previously gathered/generated and creates a website to display the different plots and info.
